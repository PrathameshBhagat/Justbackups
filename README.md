# Attempt to build an autonomous drone

# Note 
- The transmitter and reciver was ***programmed completely from scratch*** in JavaScript(J.S.) & C++, saving â‚¹4K to â‚¹10K to make delivery of medicines and goods cost effective and efficient with lowest carbon footprint.


- The ***transmitter*** was self programmed by me and was just a vanilla J.S. page with two joysticks operated from a smart phone it self.

- The ***receiver*** was as well self programmed in C++ and executed by a [Node MCU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU), just a web server, serving the J.S. page and providing the recieved pitch, yaw, roll values to the flight controller.

- The ***flight controller*** was an [Arduino UNO R3](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/) executing a third party C++ code provided by the YMFC-AL open source project. Not getting a traditional F.C. from the market added savings of atleast â‚¹5K to â‚¹15K. Totalling saving between â‚¹9K to â‚¹25K.

- Later the **transmitter** was served by a separate Python server to reduce the load on the tiny [Node MCU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NodeMCU), it used to get really hot ðŸ”¥ and hence causing an auto reset, resulting in execution of the code from the beginning of the program (which mid flight could have caused a lot of damage).

- The drone isn't very stable cause the **PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative)** values need to be tuned and lacking an aeronautics background made it difficult to tune those values.

This repo unfortunately **lacks** clean code, comments and has snippets scattered in various files, making it difficult to get used to. So please consider contacting the developer a to get an overview of the project.
